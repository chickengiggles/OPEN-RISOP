# OPEN-RISOP
This is an attempt to build an open-sourced version of the Red Integrated Strategic Operational Plan (RISOP) using an open-sourced targeting database and weapon assessment modules and consequence of execution tools. 

Future areas that I'd like to see supported:
PDCALC analysis of probability damage (PD)
Alternate Nuclear Order of Battle Analyses
HEC-RAS modeling of dam breaching
HYSPLIT modeling of ISFSI dispersion
Improved nodal analyses of dam failures
Improved nodal analyses of natural gas compressor station attacks
